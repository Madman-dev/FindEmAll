# FindEmAll
A simple but interactive game using a popular API.<br/>
Point in creating the game was to become more familiar with API calls and how to handle data.
Morever, was backed by my love for the original game.

More features will be added for learning purposes as well as personal interest.

## Using Jira
DATE | DESCRIPTION |
|:---:|---|
4.07 | - **Testing Jira Software Integration with Github** <br/> *Learned the basics of what a ticket is, how to integrate Jira with github - creating branches, commits using Jira.* |
4.11 | - **Found issue how current Jira Ticket is used** <br/> *Issued a ticket to every bugs, story, etc - although the ticket allowed me to track down the issue faster, I wasn't able to findout the main problem of the issue until I've read the commit message. NOT an effective use of tickets* |
